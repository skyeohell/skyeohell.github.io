    <p>Design: This website is pretty well designed with some animations on the home page and a pretty clear display of the website's content.</p>

    <p>Usability: While being pretty usable for most audienceâ€™s this website has some notable flaws such as 2 of the main buttons on the homepage take you to the same link, and the language they use on the website could be confusing to some.</p>

    <p>Content: Although this website contains a lot of content, including the company's goals and games, to some, its content could be overwhelming in sections and lackluster in others. </p>

    <p>Creativity: This website is quite creative with its composition and use of animations to display its content, including a moving menu bar that shifts from the top of the screen to the side so you can always see it.</p>
